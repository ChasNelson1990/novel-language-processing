# Natural Language Processing of Fiction

This repository is a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for analysing works of fiction with natural language processing techniques.
Much of this will be recreating other people's blogs and code so will be cited where appropriate.

Disclaimer: this repository is mostly just a learning exercise for myself.
